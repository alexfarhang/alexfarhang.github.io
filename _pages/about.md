<!-- I'm a PhD student at Caltech advised by Professor [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com).  I graduated from Cornell University where I studied neuroscience and behavior and worked with Professor [Jesse Goldberg](https://sites.google.com/view/goldberg-lab/) and then with Professor [Evan Feinberg](http://www.evanfeinberglab.com) at UCSF.  


I'm interested in understanding when neural networks generalize and modeling complex behavior, especially with application to neuroscience.  -->

**Research** 
&nbsp; I'm a PhD candidate at Caltech advised by Professor [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com). My work focuses on machine learning methods for agentic behavior, including humanlike gameplay in video games and large language model agents for scientific programming.
<!-- My work has ranged from understanding generalization in neural networks to AI agents for humanlike control in video games and scientific codewriting.    -->

I am a National Science Foundation Graduate Research (NSF GRFP) Fellow and a Chen Graduate Fellow.  I was a Research Intern at Epic Games, advised by [Iain Matthews](http://www.iainm.com/), where I worked on machine learning for video games.

**Previous**
&nbsp; I graduated from Cornell University where I studied neuroscience and behavior.  My thesis work with Professor [Jesse Goldberg](https://sites.google.com/view/goldberg-lab/) was awarded the Robert R. Capranica Award for the outstanding honors thesis in neuroethology. I then worked with Professor [Evan Feinberg](http://www.evanfeinberglab.com) at UCSF on sensorimotor computation and Professor [Doris Tsao](https://tsaolab.berkeley.edu) on models for object perception in the brain.
